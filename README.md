# 14a C/C++


## Agenda
1. No new things to learn today,focus is to finish C/C++ assignment.

I will assist to get your C version of the ticket system to work, if you haven't finished it yet.
If so, then you are in a hurry to port it to some degree of C++ version!

When are "FINISHED" with your assignment, make a pull-request and update the file final-assignment.txt
with your name, email and repository where you have your final assignment.

Those who are "finished", work on your code to make it even better documented and pretty!
If it is well documented and pretty ... add some test code and instructions of how to test.

Make your repository README.md nice and informative!
